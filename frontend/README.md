# Folder Structure

This document outlines the folder structure of our project, providing an overview of the organization and purpose of each directory. A well-structured project directory helps maintain code readability, modularity, and scalability.

## Table of Contents

- [src/](#src)
- [public/](#public)

## src/

The `src/` directory is where most of our project's source code resides. It contains subdirectories and files related to the application's functionality and presentation.

- **components/**: This directory houses reusable UI components. These components are primarily responsible for rendering the user interface and are often stateless. Keeping them separate promotes code reusability and maintainability.

- **features/**: This is the heart of our application. It contains subdirectories for each major feature of our application, such as product management, shopping cart, user authentication, and more. Each feature directory typically includes the following:

  - **[feature]Slice.js**: A Redux Toolkit slice specific to the feature. It defines the initial state, actions, and reducers for managing the feature's data and behavior.

  - **[Feature]List.js**: A component responsible for listing items related to the feature, such as products, orders, or users.

  - **[Feature]Detail.js**: A component for displaying detailed information about a single item within the feature.

  - Other components and files related to the feature.

- **app/**: This directory contains application-level components and configuration. It typically includes:

  - **store.js**: Configuration of the Redux store using Redux Toolkit. This is where all feature slices are combined into a root reducer.

  - **rootReducer.js**: The root reducer that combines reducers from all feature slices.

  - Other app-level components that don't belong to a specific feature but are essential for the application's functionality.

- **services/**: This directory contains functions responsible for interacting with external services, APIs, or handling data-related tasks. For example, you might have an `api.js` file that centralizes API calls.

- **assets/**: Static assets such as images, fonts, and global styles are stored here. This directory helps keep the project organized and allows easy access to assets throughout the application.

- **utils/**: Utility functions that can be used across different parts of the application. These functions help streamline common tasks and maintain code consistency.

- **routes/**: If the application uses client-side routing (e.g., React Router), this directory can house routing configuration and components responsible for rendering different views based on the URL.

- **index.js**: The entry point of the application, where we typically render the root component.

- **App.js**: The main application component that serves as the container for routing and other high-level application logic.

## public/

The `public/` directory contains publicly accessible files that are served as-is by the web server. It typically includes:

- **index.html**: The main HTML template for the application. This file may include placeholders for dynamically injected content.

- Other static assets like images, favicons, and manifest files.

By maintaining a well-organized folder structure, we aim to make the project more manageable, maintainable, and understandable. Each directory has a specific purpose and helps separate concerns, facilitating collaboration and future development.
